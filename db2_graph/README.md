To load the sample graph data:

1. Extract this archive to a machine that can connect to your Db2 instance
2. The default schema name is demo, if you wish to use a different name then you need to open each of the .sql files in the data/ directory and do a find/replace all for the schema name of your choice.
3. Connect to the Db2 database you want to use for the graph demo, db2 connect to <db_name>

        If your want to use a schema other than `DEMO` you need to update the schema
        in each of the SQL files prior to using them as well as each of the jupyter
        notebooks. It is recommended to leave the schema as DEMO if at all possible.

4. cd into the data directory and run each of the sql files in order:

        db2 -tvf 01_createTables.sql
        db2 -tvf 02_import.sql
        db2 -tvf 03_foreignKeys.sql

5. The demo uses the IBM Db2 python package, for proper setup review the requirements for your system https://github.com/ibmdb/python-ibmdb#-pre-requisites

        When using miniconda any environment variables you need to set are relative
        to the miniconda installation, for example:
        export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/<user>/miniconda3/envs/graphdemo/lib/python3.6/site-packages/clidriver/lib

6. The IBM Db2 Graph sample contains a set of Jupyter notebooks to run graph queries and visualize the results. There are specific package versions required for these notebooks and it is recommended you use minicondaÂ (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to create a graph demo environment:

        # There is an open defect with conda that may cause problems updating conda
        # Refer to https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9899#issuecomment-638098661 for a workaround:
        # cd <conda_install_dir>/lib && ln -s libffi.dylib libffi.6.dylib
        conda update conda
        conda create -n graphdemo python=3.6
        conda activate graphdemo
        pip install --no-cache-dir \ 
        gremlinpython==3.4.4 \
        ibm_db \
        pandas \
        jupyterhub==0.8.1 \
        notebook==5.7.8 \
        nbfinder
        cd <directory where you extracted the the sample notebooks>
        jupyter notebook
